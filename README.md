# CSS Box Model Demonstration

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the fundamentals of CSS styling with a focus on the CSS Box Model. It showcases how HTML elements are structured as rectangular boxes and how CSS properties like margin, padding, border, and content work together to create visual layouts.

## Files

- **index.html**: The main HTML file containing the page structure and content
- **styles.css**: The external CSS stylesheet containing all styling rules

## Features

### 1. Box Model Visualization
- Interactive demonstration of content, padding, border, and margin
- Live controls to adjust spacing values
- Visual representation of how each property affects element layout

### 2. Typography Examples
- Heading styles from H1 to H4
- Paragraph styling with various text formatting
- Link styling and hover effects

### 3. Layout Techniques
- Flexbox implementation for responsive layouts
- CSS Grid for component organization
- Spacing and alignment examples

### 4. Styled Components
- Button styles with hover effects
- Card components with shadows and rounded corners
- Interactive elements with visual feedback

## CSS Concepts Demonstrated

### Box Model Properties
- `margin`: Controls external spacing between elements
- `padding`: Controls internal spacing within elements
- `border`: Defines element boundaries
- `content`: The actual content of the element

### Styling Techniques
- Color schemes and gradients

- Flexbox and CSS Grid layouts
- Responsive design with media queries
- Hover effects and transitions
- Box shadows and rounded corners

## How to Use

3. Open `index.html` in a web browser
4. Explore the different sections to see CSS concepts in action
5. Use the interactive controls to adjust box model properties

## Browser Compatibility

This project uses modern CSS features that work in all current browsers including:
- Chrome (60+)
- Firefox (60+)
- Safari (12+)

## Code Structure

### HTML Structure
The HTML follows semantic markup practices with:
- `<header>` for the page header
- `<nav>` for navigation
- `<main>` for primary content
- `<section>` for content sections
- `<footer>` for the page footer

### CSS Organization
The CSS is organized with logical sections:
1. CSS Reset and base styles
2. Typography styles
3. Layout components
4. Box model demonstration
5. Responsive design queries

## Customization

You can easily customize this project by:
1. Modifying color variables in the CSS
2. Adjusting spacing values for different layouts
3. Adding new components following the existing patterns
4. Extending the responsive design for specific screen sizes
